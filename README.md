# This is the very first version of DESeq2 for differential gene expression analysis
# The criteria of significantly differential expressed genes are adjusted p (padj)< 0.0001 and log fold change (lfc) >2
# In the model, it only considered treatment and salinity, these two factors, no interaction term.
# The complied results for AW vs SW is actually only for coastal lake region, which is the served as baseline in this analysis.
